Parses traces generated by BAP 0.8's PIN tracer.



BAP, CMU's Binary Analysis Platform, has a pretty solid tracer ready to go.
This code gives an example program that parses BAP traces, as well as a lua
lib that parses them as well.



src/traceDump.cc gives an example of parsing a bap trace in c++.

test.lua does the same, in lua.



Requires protobuf, udis86 and lua5.2.

Does not require bap, however, you're going to need bap to generate the traces.



Code directly from BAP-0.8 is used in this codebase. All of my code here is
released into the public domain, but all of BAP's code is, of course, released
under the applicable BAP licenses. See BAP_LICENSE/ for a copy of the two
licenses BAP is released under. For any questions on BAP's license, please
refer directly to the original source.
